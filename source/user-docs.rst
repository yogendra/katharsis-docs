How to use Katharsis in your applications
=========================================

Katharsis provides means to easily expose resources over the REST interface. If you want to take a deeper look on the concepts behind Katharsis, this is page for you!


Release Notes
--------------


3.0 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- a new, more powerful JsonApiRelation annotation easing the declarations of relationships.
- QueryParams and Repository annotations have been deprecated (but resource annotations not!) and moved to a legacy package. Interface-based repositories and QuerySpec are the recommended APIs.
- major cleanup release with more test cases.
- some few package changes to non-internal classes and interfaces.
- serialization layer has been completely rewritten and is more robust/easier to understand.
- a new DocumentFilter has been introduced that allows to modify incoming requests and responses.
- many classes considered to be non-public have been moved to internal packages.
- a rewritten servlet integratino for Katharsis based on KatharsisBoot.

Features deprecated with this 3.0 releases remain support for quite some time to come. As such 
*Katharsis 3.0 remains backwards compatible with 2.x*. Some small migrations steps are necessary:

- fix package imports
- Replace all usages of QuerySpec<Xy>Repository with <Xy>RepositoryV2. 

In the medium/long-term make sure to avoid and drop the usage of any deprecated legacy API (contained in the io.katharsis.legacy packages):

- make use of interface instead of annotation-based repositories.
- make use of QuerySpec instead of QueryParams. You can perform this step gradually. Once that is completed, you can also to the next step.
- move away from DefaultQueryParamsParser in favor of DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer. Note that this step can only be done once
  all the QueryParams-based repositories have been migrated to QuerySpec. This will make your repositories fully JSON-API compliant
  (``sort`` parameter now adheres to the official specification, see below for examples).
- (recommendation) Avoid the use of ``KatharsisProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE`` and rely on a proper dependency management setup instead. Katharsis
  comes out-of-the-box with a CDI and Spring integration, both implementing the ``ServiceDiscovery`` interface.
- make use of ``JsonApiRelation`` instead of ``JsonApiToMany``, ``JsonApiToOne``, ``JsonApiLookupIncludeAutomatically`` and ``JsonApiIncludeByDefault``.
  

3.1 (soon)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- an experimental security module.
- a very experimental meta module.
- katharsis-ui


Requirements
------------

Katharsis library requires minimum Java 7 to build and run.




Supported requests
------------------

Currently Katharsis covers most of the JSON API specification request types. The following table describes available requests that are currently accepted:

.. csv-table:: A summary of the supported requests
  :header:  HTTP method, Kind of request, Sample URL,  Multiplicity of resource

  GET,	resources, "http://host.local/tasks or http://host.local/tasks/1,2", multiple
  ,resource,	http://host.local/tasks/1,	single
  ,relationship,	http://host.local/tasks/1/relationships/project,	single
  ,field,	http://host.local/tasks/1/project,	single
  POST,	resource,	http://host.local/tasks,	single
  ,field,	http://host.local/tasks/1/project,	single
  ,relationship,	http://host.local/tasks/1/relationships/project,	single
  PATCH,	resource,	http://host.local/tasks/1,	single

  DELETE,	resource,	http://host.local/tasks/1,	single
  ,relationship,	http://host.local/tasks/1/relationships/project,	single



Relationships
-------------

One of the main features of JSON API and Katharsis is support of managing relations between resources. To achieve that, two steps are required:

* Add a field annotated with JsonApiRelation, JsonApiToOne (deprecated) or JsonApiToMany (deprecated)(depending on multiplicity of the relation) which will represent a unidirectional relation.
* Add a repository which defines operations that can be made on models.


Models
------

There are several annotations which can be assigned to models. By default all fields of the model are reflected in JSON API communication except synthetic fields. The annotations described below should be associated with either a field or a getter.


JsonApiResource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is the most important annotation which defines a resource. It requires type parameter to be defined that is used to form a URLs and type field in passed JSONs. According to JSON API standard, the name defined in type can be either plural or singular

The example below shows a sample class which contains a definition of a resource.

.. code-block:: java

  @JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
  public class Task {
    // fields, getters and setters
  }


JsonApiId
~~~~~~~~~

Defines a field which will be used as an identifier of a resource.
Each resource requires this annotation to be present on a field which type implements ``Serializable`` or is of primitive type.

The example below shows a sample class which contains a definition of a field which contains an identifier.

.. code-block:: java

  @JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
  public class Task {
    @JsonApiId
    private Long id;

    // fields, getters and setters
  }


JsonApiRelation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Indicates an association to either a single value or collection of resources. The type of such fields
must be a valid resource.

The example below shows a sample class which contains this kind of relationship.


.. code-block:: java

  @JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
  public class Task {

    // ID field

    @JsonApiRelation(lookUp=LookupIncludeBehavior.AUTOMATICALLY_WHEN_NULL,serialize=SerializeType.ONLY_ID)
    private Project project;

    // fields, getters and setters
  }


The optional ``serialize`` parameter specifies how the association should be serialized when making a request.
There are two things to consider. Whether related resources should be added to the ``include`` section of the 
response document. And whether the id of related resources should be serialized along with the resource
in the corresponding ``relationships.[name].data`` section. Either ``LAZY``, ``ONLY_ID`` or ``EAGER`` can be specified:

- ``LAZY`` only serializes the ID and does the inclusion if explicitly requested by the ``include`` URL parameter. This is the default.
- ``ONLY_ID`` always serializes the ID, but does only to an inclusion  if explicitly requested by the ``include`` URL parameter.
- ``EAGER`` always both serializes the ID and does an inclusion.
  
There are two possibilities of how related resources are fetched. Either the requested repository directly
returns related resources with the returned resources. Or Katharsis can take-over that
work by doing nested calls to the corresponding ``RelationshipRepositoryV2`` implementations. The behavior
is controlled by the optional ``lookUp`` parameter. There are three options:

- 'NONE' makes the requested repository responsible for returning related resources. This is the default.
- 'AUTOMATICALLY_WHEN_NULL' will let Katharsis lookup related resources if not already done by the requested repository.
- 'AUTOMATICALLY_ALWAYS' will force Katharsis to always lookup related resource regardless whether it is already done by the requested repository.



JsonApiMetaInformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Field or getter annotated with ``JsonApiMetaInformation`` are marked to carry a ``MetaInformation`` implementation.
See http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta for more information about meta data. Example:


.. code-block:: java
	
	@JsonApiResource(type = "projects")
	public class Project {
	
		...
	
		@JsonApiMetaInformation
		private ProjectMeta meta;
	
		public static class ProjectMeta implements MetaInformation {
	
			private String value;
	
			public String getValue() {
				return value;
			}
	
			public void setValue(String value) {
				this.value = value;
			}
		}
	}



JsonApiLinksInformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Field or getter annotated with ``JsonApiLinksInformation`` are marked to carry a ``LinksInformation`` implementation.
See http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links for more information about linking. Example:


.. code-block:: java
	
	@JsonApiResource(type = "projects")
	public class Project {
	
		...
	
		@JsonApiLinksInformation
		private ProjectLinks links;
	
		public static class ProjectLinks implements MetaInformation {
	
			private String value;
	
			public String getValue() {
				return value;
			}
	
			public void setValue(String value) {
				this.value = value;
			}
		}
	}





Repositories
------------

The modelled resources must be complemented by a corresponding
repository implementation. This is achieved by implementing
one of those two repository interfaces:

  * ResourceRepositoryV2 for a resource
  * RelationshipRepositoryV2 resp. BulkRelationshipRepositoryV2 for resource relationships



ResourceRepositoryV2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Base repository which is used to operate on resources.
Each resource should have a corresponding repository implementation.
It consist of five basic methods which provide a CRUD for a resource and two parameters: the first is a type of a resource and the second is a type of the resourceâ€™s identifier.

The methods are as follows:

* ``findOne(ID id, QuerySpec querySpec)``
  Search one resource with a given ID. If a resource cannot be found, a ResourceNotFoundException exception should be thrown.
  It should return an entity with associated relationships.

* ``findAll(QuerySpec querySpec)``
  Search for all of the resources. An instance of QuerySpec can be used if necessary.
  If no resources can be found an empty Iterable or null must be returned.
  It should return entities with associated relationships.

* ``findAll(Iterable<ID>ids, QuerySpec querySpec)``
  Search for resources constrained by a list of identifiers. An instance of QuerySpec can be used if necessary.
  If no resources can be found an empty Iterable or null must be returned.
  It should return entities with associated relationships.

* ``save(S entity)``
  Saves a resource. It should not save relating relationships. A Returning resource must include assigned identifier created for the instance of resource.
  This method should be able to both create a new resource and update existing one.

* ``delete(ID id)``
  Removes a resource identified by id parameter.
  
The ResourceRepositoryBase is a base class that takes care of some boiler-plate, like implementing findOne with findAll. An
implementation can then look as simple as:

.. code-block:: java

	public class ProjectRepository extends ResourceRepositoryBase<Project, String> {
	
		private Map<Long, Project> projects = new HashMap<>();
	
		public ProjectRepository() {
			super(Project.class);
			save(new Project(1L, "Project A"));
			save(new Project(2L, "Project B"));
			save(new Project(3L, "Project C"));
		}
	
		@Override
		public synchronized void delete(String id) {
			projects.remove(id);
		}
	
		@Override
		public synchronized <S extends Project> S save(S project) {
			projects.put(project.getId(), project);
			return project;
		}
	
		@Override
		public synchronized ResourceList<Project> findAll(QuerySpec querySpec) {
			return querySpec.apply(projects.values());
		}
	}


RelationshipRepositoryV2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each relationship defined in Katharsis (annotation @JsonApiRelation, @JsonApiToOne and @JsonApiToMany ) must have a relationship repository defined.

Base unidirectional repository responsible for operations on relations.
All of the methods in this interface have fieldName field as their last parameter to solve the problem of many relationships between the same resources.

* ``setRelation(T source, D_ID targetId, String fieldName)``
  Sets a resource defined by targetId to a field fieldName in an instance source. If no value is to be set, null value is passed.

* ``setRelations(T source, Iterable<D_ID> targetIds, String fieldName)``
  Sets resources defined by targetIds to a field fieldName in an instance source. This is a all-or-nothing operation, that is no partial relationship updates are passed. If no values are to be set, empty Iterable is passed.

* ``addRelations(T source, Iterable<D_ID> targetIds, String fieldName)``
  Adds relationships to a list of relationships.

* ``removeRelations(T source, Iterable<D_ID> targetIds, String fieldName)``
  Removes relationships from a list of relationships.

* ``findOneTarget(T_ID sourceId, String fieldName, QuerySpec querySpec)``
  Finds one field's value defined by fieldName in a source defined by sourceId.

* ``findManyTargets(T_ID sourceId, String fieldName, QuerySpec querySpec)``
  Finds an Iterable of field's values defined by fieldName in a source defined by sourceId .


This interface must be implemented to let Katharsis work correctly, some of the requests are processed using only this kind of repository.
As it can be seen above, there are two kinds of methods: for multiple and single relationships and it is possible to implement only one type of methods, e.g. singular methods.
Nevertheless, it should be avoided because of potential future problems when adding new fields of other sizes.

In many cases, relationship operations can be mapped back to resource repository operations. Making the need
for a custom relationship repository implementation redundant. A findManyTargets request might can be
served by filtering the target repository. Or a relationship can be set by invoking the save operation 
on either the source or target resource repository (usually you want to save on the single-valued side).
The ResourceRepositoryBase is a base class that takes care of exactly this. A repository
implementation then looks as simple as:


.. code-block:: java

	public class ProjectToTaskRepository extends RelationshipRepositoryBase<Project, Long, Task, Long> {
	
		public ScheduleToTaskRepository() {
			super(Project.class, Task.class);
		}
	}


For this to work, relations must be set up bidirectionally with the ``opposite`` attribute:

.. code-block:: java
	
	@JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
	public class Task {
	
		@JsonApiRelation(opposite = "tasks")
		@JsonApiIncludeByDefault
		private Project project;
	
	    ...
	}


BulkRelationshipRepositoryV2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BulkRelationshipRepositoryV2 extends RelationshipRepositoryV2 and provides an additional 
``findTargets`` method. It allows to fetch a relation for multiple resources at once.
It is recommended to make use of this implementation if a relationship is loaded frequently
(either by a eager declaration or trough the ``include`` parameter) and it is costly to
fetch that relation. RelationshipRepositoryBase provides a default implementation where
``findOneTarget`` and ``findManyTargets`` forward calls to the bulk ``findTargets``.




ResourceList
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ResourceRepositoryV2 and RelationshipRepositoryV2 return lists of type ResourceList. The ResourceList can carry, next
to the actual resources, also meta and links information:

* ``getLinks()``
	Gets the links information attached to this lists.
	
* ``getMeta()``
	Gets the meta information attached to this lists.

* ``getLinks(Class<L> linksClass)``
	Gets the links information of the given type attached to this lists. If the given type is not found, null is returned.

* ``getMeta(Class<M> metaClass)``
	Gets the meta information of the given type attached to this lists. If the given type is not found, null is returned.

Thhere is a default implementation named DefaultResourceList. To gain type-safety, improved readability and katharsis-client support,
application may provide a custom implementation extending ResourceListBase:

.. code-block:: java

	class ScheduleList extends ResourceListBase<Schedule, ScheduleListMeta, ScheduleListLinks> {

	}
	
	class ScheduleListLinks implements LinksInformation {

		public String name = "value";
		
		...
	}

	class ScheduleListMeta implements MetaInformation {

		public String name = "value";
		
		...
	}
	
This implementation can then be added to a repository interface declaration
and used by both servers and clients:

.. code-block:: java

	public interface ScheduleRepository extends ResourceRepositoryV2<Schedule, Long> {
	
		@Override
		public ScheduleList findAll(QuerySpec querySpec);
		
	}







Query parameters
----------------

Katharsis passes JSON API query parameters to repositories trough a QuerySpec parameter. It holds 
request parameters like sorting and filtering specified by JSON API. The subsequent
sections will provide a number of example. 







Filtering
~~~~~~~~~

Resource filtering can be achieved by providing parameters which start with ``filter``.
The format for filters: ``filter[ResourceType][property|operator]([property|operator])* = "value"``

* ``GET /tasks/?filter[name]=Super task``
* ``GET /tasks/?filter[name][EQ]=Super task``
* ``GET /tasks/?filter[tasks][name]=Super task``
* ``GET /tasks/?filter[tasks][name]=Super task&filter[tasks][dueDate]=2015-10-01``

QuerySpec uses the ``EQ`` operator if no operator was provided. Custom operators can be registered
with ``DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer.addSupportedOperator(..)``. The default operator can be 
overridden by setting ``DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer.setDefaultOperator(...)``.


Sorting
~~~~~~~

Sorting information for the resources can be achieved by providing ``sort`` parameter.

* ``GET /tasks/?sort=name,-shortName`` 
* ``GET /tasks/?sort[projects]=name,-shortName&include=projects`` 
  


Pagination
~~~~~~~~~~

Pagination for the repositories can be achieved by providing ``page`` parameter.
The format for pagination: ``page[offset|limit] = "value", where value is an integer``

Example:

* ``GET /tasks/?page[offset]=0&page[limit]=10``


Note that JSON API specifies first, previous, next and last links (see http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination).
Katharsis provides support to compute those pagination links. For this two work, a repository
has to return meta and links information implementing PagedMetaInformation resp. PagedLinksInformation.
With PagedMetaInformation the repository can let Katharsis know about the total number of (potentially filtered)
resources. Katharsis then fills in PagedLinksInformation with the corresponding links.



Sparse Fieldsets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Information about fields to include in the response can be achieved by providing ``fields`` parameter.

* ``GET /tasks/?fields=name``
* ``GET /tasks/?fields[projects]=name,description&include=projects``



Inclusion of Related Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Information about relationships to include in the response can be achieved by providing ``include`` parameter.
The format for fields: ``include[ResourceType] = "property(.property)*"``

Examples:

* ``GET /tasks/?include[tasks]=project``
* ``GET /tasks/1/?include[tasks]=project``
* ``GET /tasks/?include[tasks]=author``
* ``GET /tasks/?include[tasks][]=author&include[tasks][]=comments``
* ``GET /tasks/?include[projects]=task&include[tasks]=comments``
* ``GET /tasks/?include[projects]=task&include=comments`` (QuerySpec example)



DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Katharsis make use of ``DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer`` to map URL parameters to a QuerySpec instance.
This instance is accessible from the various integrations, such as from the ``KatharsisFeature``. It
provides a number of customization options:

* ``setDefaultLimit(Long)``
	Sets the page limit if none is specified by the request.
	
* ``setMaxPageLimit(Long)``
	Sets the maximum page limit allowed to be requested.
	
* ``setIgnoreUnknownAttributes(boolean)``
	DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer validates all passed parameters against the domain model and fails
	if one of the attributes is unknown. This flag allows to disable that check in case the should be necessary.
	
Note that appropriate page limits are vital to protect against denial-of-service attacks when working 
with large data sets!

``DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer`` implements ``QuerySpecDeserializer`` and you may also provide your own
implementation to further customize its behavior.



QuerySpec API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The API looks like (further setters available as well):

.. code-block:: java

	public class QuerySpec {
		public <T> List<T> apply(Iterable<T> resources){...}
	
		public Long getLimit() {...}
	
		public long getOffset() {...}
	
		public List<FilterSpec> getFilters() {...}
	
		public List<SortSpec> getSort() {...}
	
		public List<IncludeFieldSpec> getIncludedFields() {...}
	
		public List<IncludeRelationSpec> getIncludedRelations() {...}
	
		public QuerySpec getQuerySpec(Class<?> resourceClass) {...}
		
		...	
	}


Note that single QuerySpec holds the parameters for a single resource type and,
in more complex scenarios, request can lead to multiple QuerySpec instances
(namely when related resources are also filtered, sorted, etc). A repository
is invoked with the QuerySpec for the requested root type. If related resources are
included in the request, their QuerySpecs can be obtained by calling ``QuerySpec.getRelatedSpec(Class)`` on the root QuerySpec. 

 ``FilterSpec`` holds a value of type object. Since URL parameters are passed as String,
 they get converted to the proper types by the ``DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer``. The 
 type is determined based on the type of the filtered attribute. 


QuerySpec provides a method ``apply`` that allows in-memory sorting, filtering and paging
on any ``java.util.Collection``. It is useful for testing and on smaller datasets to keep
the implementation of a repository as simple as possible. It returns a ResourceList
that carries a PagedMetaInformation that lets Katharsis automatically compute pagination links.



Error Handling
--------------

Processing errors in Katharsis can be handled by throwing an exception and providing
a corresponding exception mapper which defines mapping to a proper JSON API error response.

Throwing an exception...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example of throwing an Exception in the code:

.. code-block:: java

  if (somethingWentWrong()) {
    throw new SampleException("errorId", "Oops! Something went wrong.")
  }


Sample exception is nothing more than a simple runtime exception:

.. code-block:: java

  public class SampleException extends RuntimeException {

    private final String id;
    private final String title;

    public ExampleException(String id, String title) {
      this.id = id;
      this.title = title;
    }

    public String getId() {
      return id;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
      return title;
    }
  }


...and mapping it to JSON API response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Class responsible for mapping the exception should:

* be annotated with ExceptionMapperProvider
* implement JsonApiExceptionMapper interface

Sample exception mapper:

.. code-block:: java

  @ExceptionMapperProvider
  public class SampleExceptionMapper implements JsonApiExceptionMapper<SampleException> {
    @Override
    public ErrorResponse toErrorResponse(SampleException exception) {
      return ErrorResponse.builder()
        .setStatus(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR_500)
        .setSingleErrorData(ErrorData.builder()
          .setTitle(exception.getTitle())
          .setId(exception.getId())
          .build())
        .build();
    }
  }

Exception mapper classes will be scanned for and registered during application startup.
They should be located in your resource search package. If katharsis-cdi or katharsis-spring
is used, the annotation is not necessary and it will instead be picked up through the
dependency mechanisms.

An exception should be mapped to an ErrorResponse object.
It consists of an HTTP status and ErrorData (which is consistent with JSON API error structure).

Note that the exception mapper is reponsible for providing the logging of exceptions with the
appropriate log levels. Also have a look at the subsequent section about the validation module that takes
care of JSR-303 bean validation exception mapping. 


Meta Information
----------------

.. note::
  With ResourceList and @JsonApiMetaInformation meta information can be returned directly. A MetaRepository implementation is no longer necessary.

There is a special interface which can be added to resource repositories to provide meta information: ``io.katharsis.repository.MetaRepository``.
It contains a single method ``MetaInformation getMetaInformation(Iterable<T> resources)`` which return meta information object that implements the marker ``interface io.katharsis.response.MetaInformation``.

If you want to add meta information along with the responses, all repositories (those that implement ``ResourceRepository`` and ``RelationshipRepository``) must implement ``MetaRepository``.

When using annotated versions of repositories, a method that returns a ``MetaInformation`` object should be annotated with ``JsonApiMeta`` and the first parameter of the method must be a list of resources.

Links Information
-----------------

.. note::
  With ResourceList and @JsonApiLinksInformation links information can be returned directly. A LinksRepository implementation is no longer necessary.

There is a special interface which can be added to resource repositories to provide links information: ``io.katharsis.repository.LinksRepository``.
It contains a single method ``LinksInformation getLinksInformation(Iterable<T> resources)`` which return links information object that implements the marker ``interface io.katharsis.response.LinksInformation``.

If you want to add meta information along with the responses, all repositories (those that implement ``ResourceRepository`` and ``RelationshipRepository``), must implement ``LinksRepository``.

When using annotated versions of repositories, a method that returns a ``LinksInformation`` object should be annotated with ``JsonApiLinks`` and the first parameter of the method has to be a list of resources.



JAX-RS integration
------------------

Katharsis allows integration with JAX-RS environments through the usage of JAX-RS specification. Under the hood there is a @PreMatching filter which checks each request for JSON API processing.

There are two ways to setup to integrate Katharsis into a JAX-RS application, depending on whether a dependency injection framework is in use.
In either case the instantiated ``KatharsisFeature`` has to be registered as a JAX-RS feature. 


Without Dependency Injection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Have a look at the Dropwizard example to see how to setup Katharsis without dependency injection.

Katharsis require an instance of every resources repository it finds. To provide them, ``JsonServiceLocator`` interface has to be implemented. 
The created instance of ``JsonServiceLocator`` has to be provided to new instance of ``KatharsisFeature`` along with Jackson Databind ObjectMapper.

.. code-block:: java
	
	@ApplicationPath("/")
	public class MyApplication extends Application {
	
		@Override
		public Set<Object> getSingletons() {
			KatharsisFeature katharsisFeature = new KatharsisFeature(environment.getObjectMapper(),
	                new DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer(),
	                new SampleJsonServiceLocator());
			return Collections.singleton((Object)katharsisFeature);
		}
		
		@Override
		public Map<String, Object> getProperties() {
			Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
			map.put(KatharsisProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE, "com.myapplication.model")
			return map;
		}
	}

In order for Katharsis to find its resources and repository, the ``katharsis.config.core.resource.package`` configuration property must be passed
to JAX-RS. It allows configuring from which package should be searched to get models, repositories used by the core and exception mappers 
used to map thrown from repositories exceptions. Multiple packages can be passed by specifying a comma separated string 
of packages i.e. com.company.service.dto,com.company.service.repository. 



With Dependency Injection (CDI, Spring)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The setup is simplified if a dependency injection framework like CDI or Spring is available. In this case, Katharsis can lookup its repositories, modules,
etc. with that framework. To enable CDI support, add ``io.katharsis:katharsis-cdi`` to your classpath. Katharsis will then pickup the ``CdiServiceDiscovery`` implementation
and use it to discover its modules and repositories. An application then looks as simple as:

.. code-block:: java

	@ApplicationPath("/")
	public class WildflyApplication extends Application {
	
		@Override
		public Set<Class<?>> getClasses() {
			Set<Class<?>> set = new HashSet<>();
			set.add(KatharsisFeature.class);
			return set;
		}
	}


Have a look at the wildfly example. The Spring setup follows the same pattern with a ``SpringServiceDiscovery``
and is explained in a subsequent section.


Providing a configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three parameters that can be passed to the server to get the configuration.
All of them are defined in KatharsisProperties class:


* ``katharsis.config.core.resource.domain``

  Domain name as well as protocol and optionally port number used when building links objects in responses i.e. http://katharsis.io.
  The value must not end with ``/``. If the property is omitted, then they are extracted from the incoming request, which should work
  well for most use cases.

* ``katharsis.config.web.path.prefix`` (Optional)

  Default prefix of a URL path used in two cases:

  * When building ``links`` objects in responses
  * When performing method matching

  An example of a prefix ``/api/v1``.




Customizing KatharsisFeature 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``KatharsisFeature`` has a number of  constructors and methods that allow to
customize its behavior. A more advanced setup may look like:

.. code-block:: java

	public class MyAdvancedKatharsisFeature implements Feature {
	
		@Inject
		private EntityManager em;
	
		@Inject
		private EntityManagerFactory emFactory;
	
		...
			
		@Override
		public boolean configure(FeatureContext featureContext) {
			featureContext.property(KatharsisProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE, ...);
			featureContext.property(KatharsisProperties.WEB_PATH_PREFIX, ...);
	
			// also map entities to JSON API resources (see further below)
			JpaModule jpaModule = new JpaModule(emFactory, em, transactionRunner);
			jpaModule.setRepositoryFactory(new ValidatedJpaRepositoryFactory());
	
			// JSON API compliant URL handling with QuerySpec
			DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer querySpecDeserializer = new DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer();
			
			// limit all incoming requests to 20 resources if not specified otherwise
			querySpecDeserializer.setDefaultLimit(20L);
			
			ServiceLocator serviceLocator = ...
			KatharsisFeature feature = new KatharsisFeature(new ObjectMapper(), querySpecDeserializer, serviceLocator);
			feature.addModule(jpaModule);
	
			featureContext.register(feature);
			return true;
		}
	}
	
Note that if the CDI or Spring integration is used, it will pickup any modules automatically.




Repository supported parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JAX-RS integration allows a developer to pass the following types of parameters in repository methods:

* An instance of ``ContainerRequestContext``
* An instance of ``SecurityContext``
* A cookie. The parameter should be annotated with ``@CookieParam("cookie name")``.
  The type can be either ``Cookie``, ``String`` or any other type that Jackson can handle.
* A header. The parameter should be annotated with ``@HeaderParam("header name")``.
  The type can be either ``String`` or any other type that Jackson can handle.

Servlet integration
-------------------

There are two ways of integrating katharsis using Servlets:

* Adding an instance of ``AbstractKatharsisServlet``
* Adding an instance of ``AbstractKatharsisFilter``

Integrating using a Servlet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate Katharsis using a servlet several steps are required.
The first one is to create a class that extends ``AbstractKatharsisServlet`` and will provide required configuration for the library.
The code below shows a sample implementation:

.. code-block:: java

  import io.katharsis.invoker.KatharsisInvokerBuilder;
  import io.katharsis.locator.JsonServiceLocator;
  import io.katharsis.locator.SampleJsonServiceLocator;

  import javax.servlet.ServletConfig;
  import javax.servlet.ServletException;

  public class SampleKatharsisServlet extends AbstractKatharsisServlet {

      private String resourceSearchPackage;
      private String resourceDefaultDomain;

      @Override
      public void init(ServletConfig servletConfig) throws ServletException {
          super.init(servletConfig);
          resourceSearchPackage = servletConfig
              .getInitParameter(KatharsisProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE);
          resourceDefaultDomain = servletConfig
              .getInitParameter(KatharsisProperties.RESOURCE_DEFAULT_DOMAIN);
      }

      /**
       * NOTE: A class extending this must provide a platform specific {@link JsonServiceLocator}
       *       instead of the (testing-purpose) {@link SampleJsonServiceLocator} below

       */
      @Override
      protected KatharsisInvokerBuilder createKatharsisInvokerBuilder() {
          return new KatharsisInvokerBuilder()
              .resourceSearchPackage(resourceSearchPackage)
              .resourceDefaultDomain(resourceDefaultDomain)
              .jsonServiceLocator(new SampleJsonServiceLocator());
      }

  }

The newly created servlet must be added to the ``web.xml`` file or to another deployment descriptor.
The code below shows a sample ``web.xml`` file with a properly defined and configured servlet:

.. code-block:: java

  <web-app>
    <servlet>
      <servlet-name>SampleKatharsisServlet</servlet-name>
      <servlet-class>io.katharsis.servlet.SampleKatharsisServlet</servlet-class>
      <init-param>
        <param-name>katharsis.config.core.resource.package</param-name>
        <param-value>io.katharsis.servlet.resource</param-value>
      </init-param>
      <init-param>
        <param-name>katharsis.config.core.resource.domain</param-name>
        <param-value>http://localhost:8080</param-value>
      </init-param>
    </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
      <servlet-name>SampleKatharsisServlet</servlet-name>
      <url-pattern>/api/v1/ *</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
  </web-app>


Integrating using a filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate Katharsis using a filter, several steps are required.
First, create a class that extends ``AbstractKatharsisFilter``, which will provide required configuration for the library.
The code below shows a sample implementation:

.. code-block:: java

  import io.katharsis.invoker.KatharsisInvokerBuilder;
  import io.katharsis.locator.JsonServiceLocator;
  import io.katharsis.locator.SampleJsonServiceLocator;

  import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;
  import javax.servlet.ServletException;

  public class SampleKatharsisFilter extends AbstractKatharsisFilter {

      private String resourceSearchPackage;
      private String resourceDefaultDomain;

      public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
          super.init(filterConfig);
          resourceSearchPackage = filterConfig
              .getInitParameter(KatharsisProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE);
          resourceDefaultDomain = filterConfig
              .getInitParameter(KatharsisProperties.RESOURCE_DEFAULT_DOMAIN);
      }

      @Override
      public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
          super.init(filterConfig);
          resourceSearchPackage = filterConfig
              .getInitParameter(KatharsisProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE);
          resourceDefaultDomain = filterConfig
              .getInitParameter(KatharsisProperties.RESOURCE_DEFAULT_DOMAIN);
      }

      /**
       * NOTE: A class extending this must provide a platform specific {@link JsonServiceLocator}
       *       instead of the (testing-purpose) {@link SampleJsonServiceLocator} below
       *       in order to provide advanced dependency injections for the repositories.
       */
      @Override
      protected KatharsisInvokerBuilder createKatharsisInvokerBuilder() {
          return new KatharsisInvokerBuilder()
              .resourceSearchPackage(resourceSearchPackage)
              .resourceDefaultDomain(resourceDefaultDomain)
              .jsonServiceLocator(new SampleJsonServiceLocator());
      }
  }

The newly created filter must be added to ``web.xml`` file or other deployment descriptor.
A code below shows a sample ``web.xml`` file with properly defined and configured filter

.. code-block:: xml

  <web-app>
    <filter>
      <filter-name>SampleKatharsisFilter</filter-name>
      <filter-class>io.katharsis.servlet.SampleKatharsisFilter</filter-class>
      <init-param>
        <param-name>katharsis.config.web.path.prefix</param-name>
        <param-value>/api/v1</param-value>
      </init-param>
      <init-param>
        <param-name>katharsis.config.core.resource.package</param-name>
        <param-value>io.katharsis.servlet.resource</param-value>
      </init-param>
      <init-param>
        <param-name>katharsis.config.core.resource.domain</param-name>
        <param-value>http://localhost:8080</param-value>
      </init-param>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>SampleKatharsisFilter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/api/v1/ *</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
  </web-app>


Repository supported parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Servlet integration allows the following types of parameters in repository methods:

* An instance of ``ServletContext``
* An instance of ``HttpServletRequest``
* An instance of ``HttpServletResponse``


Spring integration
------------------

Katharsis provides a simple Spring Boot integration using the ``@Configuration`` annotated class ``KatharsisConfigV3``.
Using this class, the only thing needed to allow Katharsis process requests is parameter configuration.
An example ``application.properties`` file is presented below.

.. code-block:: bash

  katharsis.domainName=http://localhost:8080
  katharsis.pathPrefix=/api

Spring integration uses katharsis-servlet ``AbstractKatharsisFilter`` to fetch the requests. Similar to CDI, repositories
and modules are picked up from the Spring ApplicationContext with  ``SpringServiceDiscovery``.


Repository supported parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spring integration allows a developer to pass all of the types supported by Spring which don't operate on the response.



Vertx integration
-----------------

Katharsis provides ``Handler`` that intercepts requests and delegates them to Katharsis.

.. code-block:: bash

  dependencies {
      compile 'io.katharsis:katharsis-vertx:<version>'
  }


Simple usage example that creates the handler:

.. code-block:: java

  KatharsisHandler katharsisGlue = KatharsisHandlerFactory.create(Main.class.getPackage().getName(), "/api");
  router.route("/api/*").handler(katharsisGlue);

Advanced usage that shows how you can inject custom parameters in Katharsis repository methods:

.. code-block:: java

  ParameterProviderFactory factory = new SpringParameterProviderFactory(Json.mapper, context);

  KatharsisHandler katharsisGlue = KatharsisHandlerFactory.create(Main.class.getPackage().getName(), "/api",
  Json.mapper, new CustomParameterProviderFactory(Json.mapper, context));
  router.route("/api/*").handler(katharsisGlue);


Client
-----------------

There is a Katharsis client for Java projects to allow
communicating with JSON-API compliant servers. Two http client libraries are supported:

* `OkHttp <http://square.github.io/okhttp>`
  Library has been used to allow usage in both Android and server applications and services.

* `Apache Http Client <https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/index.html>`
  Library widely used in the Java community.
  
Add one of those library to the classpath and Katharsis will pick it up automatically.
  
The client requires to define resources in the same manner as defined in the `Models`_ section.
To start using the client just create an instance of ``KatharsisClient`` and pass the service
URL and the location to the package where the models are defined.

The client has three main methods:

* ``KatharsisClient#getRepositoryForInterface(Class)`` to obtain a resource repository stub from an existing repository interface.
* ``KatharsisClient#getRepositoryForType(Class)`` to obtain a generic resource repository stub from the provided resource type.
* ``KatharsisClient#getRepositoryForType(Class, Class)`` to obtain a generic relationship repository stub from the provided source and target resource types.

The interface of the repositories is as same as defined in `Repositories`_ section.

An example of the usage:

.. code-block:: java

  KatharsisClient client = new KatharsisClient("http://localhost:8080/api");
  ResourceRepositoryV2<Task, Long> taskRepo = client.getRepositoryForType(Task.class);
  List<Task> tasks = taskRepo.findAll(new QuerySpec(Task.class));

Have a look at, for example, the QuerySpecClientTest to see more examples of how it is used.



HTTP customization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to hook into the HTTP implementation used by Katharsis (OkHttp or Apache). 
Make use of ``KatharsisClient#getHttpAdapter()`` and cast it to either 
``HttpClientAdapter`` or ``OkHttpAdapter``. Both implementations provide a 
``addListener`` method, which in turn gives access to the native builder used to construct
the respective HTTP client implementation. This allows to cover various use cases:

- add custom request headers (security, tracing, etc.)
- collect statistics
- ...

You may have a look at ``katharsis-brave`` for an advanced example.



Modules
-----------------

Katharsis has a module API that allows to extend the core functionality by third-party contributions.
The mentioned JPA module in the next section is an example for that. The API is similar in spirit
to the one of the ``https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson``. The main interface is ``Module`` with
a default implementation provided by ``SimpleModule``. A module has access to a ``ModuleContext``
that allows to register all kinds of extensions like new ``ResourceInformationBuilder``,
``ResourceLookup``, ``Filter``, ``ExceptionMapper`` and Jackson modules. It also gives access to the
``ResourceRegistry`` holding information about all the repositories registered to katharsis.
The ``JpaModule`` in ``katharsis-jpa`` provides a good, more advanced example of using the
module API.



Request Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Katharsis provides three different, complementing mechanisms to hook into the request processing.



The ``DocumentFilter`` interface allows to intercept incoming requests and do 
any kind of validation, changes, monitoring, transaction handling, etc. ``DocumentFilter`` can be 
hooked into Katharsis by setting up a module and registering the filter to the 
``ModuleContext``. Not that for every request, this interface is called exactly once.

A request may span multiple repository accesses. To intercept the actual repository requests,
implement the ``RepositoryFilter`` interface. ``RepositoryFilter`` has a number of methods
that allow two intercept the repository request at different stages. Like ``Filter`` it can be 
hooked into Katharsis by setting up a module and registering the filter to the 
``ModuleContext``. 

Similar to ``RepositoryFilter`` it is possible to decorate a repository with another repository
implementing the same Katharsis repository interfaces. The decorated repository instead of 
the actual repository will get called and it is up to the decorated repository of how to proceed
with the request, usually by calling the actual repository. ``RepositoryDecoratorFactory``
can be registered with ``ModuleContext.addRepositoryDecoratorFactory``. The factory gets
notified about every repository registration and is then free do decorate it or not.


		


Integrate third-party data stores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core of Katharsis is quite flexible when it comes to implementing repositories. As such, it is 
not mandatory to make use of the Katharsis annotations and conventions. Instead, it is also
(likely) possible to integrate an existing data store setup like JPA, JDBC, ElasticSearch, etc.
into Katharsis. For this purpose a module can provide custom implementations of 
``ResourceInformationBuilder`` and ``RepositoryInformationBuilder`` trough
``ModuleContext.addResourceInformationBuilder`` and ``ModuleContext.addRepositoryInformationBuilder``. 
For example, the JpaModule of  ``katharsis-jpa`` makes use of that to read JPA instead of Katharsis annotations. 
Such a module can then register additional (usually dynamic) repositories with 
``ModuleContext.addRepository``.

Integrate into a dependency injection environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Katharsis comes with out-of-the-box support for Spring and CDI. Both of them implement 
``ServiceDiscovery``. You may provide your own implementation which can be hooked into the
various Katharsis integrations, like the KatharsisFeature. Modules have access to that
``ServiceDiscover`` trough the ``ModuleContext``.

Let a module hook into the Katharsis HTTP client implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modules for the Katharsis client can additionally implement ``HttpAdapterAware``. It gives
the module access to the underlying HTTP client implementation and allows abitrary 
customizations of it. Have a look at the Katharsis client documentation for more information.




JPA Module
-------------

The JPA module allows to automatically expose JPA entities as JSON API repositories. No implementation
or Katharsis-specific annotations are necessary.

The feature set includes:

- expose JPA entities to JSON API endpoints
- expose JPA relations as JSON API endpoints
- decide which entities to expose as endpoints
- sorting, filtering, paging, inclusion of related resources
- JPA filter API to modify the issued queries
- JPA Criteria API and QueryDSL support
- DTO mapping support
- support for computed attributes behaving like regular, persisted attributes.


JPA Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the module, add a dependency to ``io.katharsis:katharsis-jpa`` and register the ``JpaModule`` 
to Katharsis. For example in the case of JAX-RS:

.. code-block:: java

	TransactionRunner transactionRunner = ...;
	JpaModule jpaModule = JpaModule.newServerModule(entityManagerFactory, entityManager, transactionRunner);
	jpaModule.setRepositoryFactory(new ValidatedJpaRepositoryFactory());
	
	KatharsisFeature feature = new KatharsisFeature(...);
	feature.addModule(jpaModule);
			

The JPA modules by default looks up the entityManagerFactory and obtains a list
of registered JPA entities. For each entity a instance of ``JpaEntityRepository``
is registered to Katharsis using the module API. Accordingly, every relation
is registered as ``JpaRelationshipRepository``. ``JpaModule.setRepositoryFactory``
allows to provide a factory to change or customized the used repositories.
To manually select the entities exposed to Katharsis use ``JpaModule.addEntityClass(...)`` 
and ``JpaModule.removeEntityClass(...)``. If no ``entityManagerFactory`` is provided
to newServerModule, then the registartion of entities is omitted and can be done
manually.
	
The transactionRunner needs to be implemented by the application to hook into the
transaction processing of the used environment (Spring, JEE, etc.). This might be
as simple as a Spring bean implementing ``TransactionRunner`` and adding a 
``@Transactional`` annotation. The JPA module makes sure that every call to a 
repository happens within such a transaction boundary.

To setup a Katharsis client with the JPA module use:


.. code-block:: java

	client = new KatharsisClient(getBaseUri().toString(), ...);

	JpaModule module = JpaModule.newClientModule(TestEntity.class.getPackage().getName());
	setupModule(module, false);
	client.addModule(module);
	
The JpaModule takes care of the lookup of the entities and registering them to Katharsis
with the provided package passed to ``newClientModule``.	

Have a look at https://github.com/katharsis-project/katharsis-framework/blob/develop/katharsis-jpa/src/test/java/io/katharsis/jpa/JpaQuerySpecEndToEndTest.java within the ``katharsis-jpa``
test cases to see how everything is used together with ``katharsis-client``.
The JPA modules further has a number of more advanced customization options that
are discussed in the subsequent sections.


Criteria API and QueryDSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JPA module can work with two different query APIs, the default Criteria API
and QueryDSL. ``JpaModule.setQueryFactory`` allows
to choose between those two implementation. There is the ``JpaCriteriaQueryFactory``
and the ``QuerydslQueryFactory``. By default the Criteria API is used.
QueryDSL sits on top of JPQL and has to advantage of being easier to use. 


Customizing the JPA repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The setup page outlined the ``JpaRepositoryFactory`` that can be used to hook a custom JPA repository
implementations into the JPA module. The JPA module further provides a more
lightweight filter API to perform various changes to JPA repository requests:

``JpaModule.addFilter(new MyRepositoryFilter())``

A filter looks like:

.. code-block:: java

	public class MyRepositoryFilter extends JpaRepositoryFilterBase {

		boolean accept(Class<?> resourceType){...}

		<T, I extends Serializable> JpaEntityRepository<T, I> filterCreation(JpaEntityRepository<T, I> repository){...}
	
		QuerySpec filterQuerySpec(Object repository, QuerySpec querySpec){...}
		
		...
	}


The various filter methods allow a wide variety of customizations or also to replace the passed object in question.


DTO Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mapping to DTO objects is supported with ``JpaModule.registerMappedEntityClass(...)``.
A mapper then can be provided that translates the Entity to a DTO class.
Such a mapper might be implemented manually or generated (mostly) automatically
with tools like MapStruct. If two mapped entities are registered, there
respective mapped relationships will be automatically registered as well. 

The mechanism is not limited to simple mappings, but can also introduce computed 
attributes like in the example depicted here:

.. code-block:: java

	JpaModule module = JpaModule.newServerModule(emFactory, em, transactionRunner);
				module.setQueryFactory(QuerydslQueryFactory.newInstance());
	QuerydslExpressionFactory<QTestEntity> basicComputedValueFactory = new QuerydslExpressionFactory<QTestEntity>() {

		@Override
		public Expression<String> getExpression(QTestEntity parent, JPAQuery<?> jpaQuery) {
			return parent.stringValue.upper();
		}
	};

	QuerydslQueryFactory queryFactory = (QuerydslQueryFactory) module.getQueryFactory();
	queryFactory.registerComputedAttribute(TestEntity.class, TestDTO.ATTR_COMPUTED_UPPER_STRING_VALUE,
		 String.class, basicComputedValueFactory);
	module.addMappedEntityClass(TestEntity.class, TestDTO.class, new TestDTOMapper(entityManager));
	
and

.. code-block:: java
	
	public class TestDTOMapper implements JpaMapper<TestEntity, TestDTO> {
	
		@Override
		public TestDTO map(Tuple tuple) {
			TestDTO dto = new TestDTO();
			TestEntity entity = tuple.get(0, TestEntity.class);
			dto.setId(entity.getId());
			dto.setStringValue(entity.getStringValue());
			dto.setComputedUpperStringValue(tuple.get("computedUpperStringValue", String.class));
			...
			return dto;
		}
		
		...
	
	}

Some of the regular entity attributes are mapped to the DTO. But there is also a 
``computedUpperStringValue`` attribute that is computed with an expression.
The expression can be written with the Criteria API or QueryDSL depending
on which query backend is in use.

Computed attributes are indistinguishable from regular, persisted entity attributes.
They can be used for selection, sorting and filtering. Both ``JpaCriteriaQueryFactory`` 
and ``QuerydslQueryFactory`` provide a ``registerComputedAttribute`` method to 
register an expression factory to create such computed attributes. The registration requires 
the target entity and a name. To make the computed attribute available
to consumers, the mapper class has access to it trough the provided 
tuple class. Have a look at https://github.com/katharsis-project/katharsis-framework/blob/develop/katharsis-jpa/src/test/java/io/katharsis/jpa/mapping/DtoMappingTest.java to see everything in use.

There is currently not yet any support for renaming of attribute. If attributes
are renamed on DTOs, the incoming QuerySpec has to be modified accordingly to
match again the entity attribute naming.



JSR 303 Validation Module
-------------------------

A ``ValidationModule`` provided by ``io.katharsis:katharsis-validation`` implements 
exception mappers for 'javax.validation.ValidationException' and 'javax.validation.ConstraintViolationException'.
Among others, it properly translates 'javax.validation.ConstraintViolation' instances to JSON API errors.
A JSON API error can, among others, contain a source pointer. This source pointer allows a clients/UI to
display the validation errors next to the corresponding input fields.


Tracing with Zipkin/Brave
-------------------------

A ``BraveModule`` provided by ``io.katharsis:katharsis-brave`` provides integration into
Zipkin/Brave to implement tracing for your repositories.  The module is applicable to 
both a Katharsis client or server.

The Katharsis client can make use of either HttpClient or OkHttp to issue HTTP requests.
Accordingly, a matching brave integration must be added to the classpath:

* ``io.zipkin.brave:brave-okhttp``
* ``io.zipkin.brave:brave-apache-http-interceptors``

The ``BraveModule`` then takes care of the integration and will create a client span
for each request.

On the server-side, ``BraveModule`` creates a local span for each accessed repository.
Every request triggers one or more repository accesses (depending on whether 
relations are included). Note however that ``BraveModule`` does not setup tracing
for incoming requests. That is the purpose of the JAX-RS/servlet integration of Brave.


Security Module
-------------------------

This is an experimental module that intercepts all repository requests and performs Role-based access
control. Have a look at the ``SecurityModule`` and the related ``SecurityConfig`` class.
A setup can looks as follows:


.. code-block:: java

	Builder builder = SecurityConfig.builder();
	builder.permitRole("allRole", ResourcePermission.ALL);
	builder.permitRole("getRole", ResourcePermission.GET);
	builder.permitRole("patchRole", ResourcePermission.PATCH);
	builder.permitRole("postRole", ResourcePermission.POST);
	builder.permitRole("deleteRole", ResourcePermission.DELETE);
	builder.permitRole("taskRole", Task.class, ResourcePermission.ALL);
	builder.permitRole("taskReadRole", Task.class, ResourcePermission.GET);
	builder.permitRole("projectRole", Project.class, ResourcePermission.ALL);
	builder.permitAll(ResourcePermission.GET);
	builder.permitAll(Project.class, ResourcePermission.POST);
	securityModule = SecurityModule.newServerModule(builder.build());

The security module further properly serializes javax.security 
authorization and authentication exceptions. As such it is also recommended to be 
used by KatharsisClient.


Meta Module
-------------------------

This is a (very) experimental module that exposes the internal workings of Katharsis as JSON API repositories.
It lets you browse the set of available resources, their types, their attributes, etc. For example,
Katharsis UI make use of the meta module to implement auto-completing of input fields.
A setup can look as follows:

.. code-block:: java

		MetaModule metaModule = MetaModule.create();
		metaModule.addMetaProvider(new ResourceMetaProvider());

To learn more about the set of available resources, have a look at the ``MetaElement`` class and all its subclasses,
most notably ``MetaResource`` and ``MetaResourceRepository``.
